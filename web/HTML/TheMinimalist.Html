    <h1>The Minimalist Web: Crafting Pages with Only the Basics</h1>

    <h2>The Back-to-Basics Movement</h2>
    <p>
        Back in the early days of the internet, webpages were nothing more than plain text, sprinkled with <b>bold</b> and <i>italic</i> styles. The focus was on the content, not the decoration. In many ways, this was the golden age of readability.
    </p>
    <p>
        The HTML language itself was designed for structure — headings, paragraphs, and semantic meaning. E = mc<sup>2</sup> still looks good without a single pixel of CSS, and H<sub>2</sub>O remains as clear as ever.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Strip It Down?</h2>
    <p>
        There’s a quiet beauty in simplicity. Without distractions, readers focus on the words. Minimalism is not the lack of something, it’s the <em>perfect amount</em> of something, as a famous designer once said.
    </p>
    <p>
        Removing images and heavy layouts means faster load times, better accessibility, and even nostalgia for the chaotic simpler internet days.
    </p>

    <h2>Magazine-Style Sections</h2>
    <p>
        Just like in a printed magazine, articles can be divided with bold headings and subtle separators. Think of <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code> as the thin line between chapters, and headings as your section titles.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can even keep a “side note” feel with <small>smaller text</small> for author comments or additional reading hints.
    </p>

    <h2>A Practical Demonstration</h2>
    <p>
        Imagine we are describing a recipe in this minimal style:
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Step 1:</b> Mix 250g of flour with H<sub>2</sub>O until smooth.<br>
        <b>Step 2:</b> Heat at 180&deg;C for 30 minutes.<br>
        <b>Step 3:</b> Serve cold<br>
        Serve warm for best taste.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Code snippet:</b> <code>temperature = 180; // degrees Celsius</code>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>The Closing Thought</h2>
    <p>
        Stripping a webpage down to its bare essentials is not just a design choice — it’s a statement. It says: <b>The words matter more than the wrapping.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        So the next time you open a code editor, try creating a page with nothing but headings, paragraphs, and text formatting. You might just rediscover the timeless elegance of the early web.
